        <p id="lloydDobler"><a href="staffPics/lloydDobler.jpg">Lloyd</a>
        Lloyd invented our recipe.  To know Lloyd is to love our fortune cookies.  You're about to get to know Lloyd.  During teen years filled with 1980s angst, Lloyd survived both suicide and assasination attempts.  He later briefly earned his living as a professional assassin before marrying Betsy Driver and settling down into the sordid life of a pastry chef.

        <p id="vincentAndOldBob"><a href="staffPics/vincentAndOldBob.jpg">Vincent & Old Bob</a>
        Vincent and Old Bob make most of our fine cookies on a daily basis, employing an artisianl blend of modern lasers, 1960s craftsmanship, a rather intimate knowledge of black holes (and also commercial mixers & baking ovens).

        George is our morale officer. He helps us keep the faith. After all, fortune cookie making is an emotionally devastating experience.  It requires impeccable craft and attention to detail.  It requires a strong stomach to learn and process the fortunes and futures of countless Chinese food afficionados.

        <p id="uncleIroh"><a href="staffPics/uncleIroh.png">Iroh</a>
        Uncle Iroh is our resident sage.  A former general and perhaps the world's foremost authority on tea, Iroh daily travels to the spirit world to discover the fortunes of all of our end users and, upon his return, painstakingly writes each on tiny little scrolls of finest Egyptian parchment using a quill pen made from the feather of a chimera's head, using ink drawn from the Kraken.

        <p id="franklinPierce"><a href="staffPics/franklinPierce.jpg">Frank</a>
        Frank is our company's president.  Another war hero, Frank served terms as a congressman and Senator before all his children died tragically. Spiralling into alcoholosism, Frank discovered that fortune cookies pair incredibly well with most whiskeys.  Now 157 years in recovery, Frank has found new meaning in helping craft the world's finest artisianal fortune cookies.
